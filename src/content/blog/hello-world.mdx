Welcome to my blog.

I'm Manik, a software engineer based in Hong Kong. I work on payment infrastructure at Hero Plus Group, building systems that process transactions across Southeast Asia.

## What I'll Write About

- **Technical deep dives** into payment systems, distributed systems, and architecture decisions
- **Product engineering** lessons from building products from zero to one
- **Tools and workflows** that help me work more effectively

## Why Write?

Writing helps me think more clearly. By explaining concepts, I solidify my own understanding and hopefully help others who are navigating similar problems.

Stay tuned for more posts.
