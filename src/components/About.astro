        <p>
          I'm a software engineer based in Hong Kong, currently working as a <strong class="text-gray-900 dark:text-neutral-50 font-medium">Founding Engineer at Hero Plus Group</strong>, where I architect and build payment infrastructure serving merchants across Southeast Asia.
        </p>

        <p>
          My work spans the full stack &mdash; from designing PCI-compliant multi-gateway payment systems handling transactions across Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, to building React frontends and managing AWS infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before Hero Plus, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Hong Kong, developing AR therapeutic games for stroke rehabilitation using computer vision and Unity. I also co-founded Solvfit, a skill-based talent matching platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          I studied Computer Science at HKU, where I built a foundation in distributed systems, machine learning, and software architecture. Outside of work, I'm interested in fintech, developer tools, and building products that solve real problems.
