## Overview

During my time as a Research Assistant at the University of Hong Kong, I developed AR therapeutic games designed to help stroke patients with rehabilitation exercises.

## Key Achievements

- **Increased therapy adherence by 40%** through intuitive, gamified rehabilitation experiences
- **Improved rehabilitation accuracy by 35%** with real-time motion tracking and exercise-form analysis
- **Collaborated with physicians and therapists** to translate clinical requirements into game features

## Technical Implementation

### Computer Vision Pipeline
- Real-time object recognition for therapy equipment
- Motion tracking to monitor patient movements
- Exercise-form analysis for providing feedback

### Unity Development
- Built multiple rehabilitation mini-games
- Adaptive difficulty based on patient progress
- Visual feedback systems for correct form

## Research Impact

The project demonstrated how AR and gamification can significantly improve patient engagement in stroke rehabilitation, potentially reducing recovery time and improving outcomes.
